# GitHub Workflow Optimization Results

This document tracks the performance improvements made to `.github/workflows/test-contract.yml`.

## Methodology
- Each change is tested individually with a 10-minute wait between runs
- Times are measured from GitHub Actions UI (total workflow duration)
- All tests run on ubuntu-latest runners

## Baseline Performance
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #37
- **Total Workflow Time**: 9m 8s (548 seconds)
- **Breakdown**:
  - setup-environment job: 12s
  - sozo-test job: 8m 4s (484s)
  - scarb-fmt job: 9s

## Optimization Results

### 1. Remove unnecessary setup-environment job
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #38
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 23s (503 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 45 seconds (8.2% improvement)
- **Notes**: Removed redundant curl installation. Jobs now run in parallel from the start.

### 2. Update to latest actions
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #39
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 19s (499 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 4 seconds (0.8% improvement from previous)
- **Notes**: Minor improvement from v2/v3 to v4. Benefit more noticeable on larger repos.

### 3. Add timeout-minutes
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #40
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 18s (498 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 1 second (no performance impact, adds safety)
- **Notes**: Prevents hanging jobs. No performance gain but important for reliability.

### 4. Combine jobs into single job
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #41
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 13s (493 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 5 seconds (1.0% improvement from previous)
- **Notes**: Eliminated second runner startup. Smaller gain than expected due to parallel execution loss.

### 5. Optimize file path ignores
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #42
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 30s (510 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: -17 seconds (slower due to workflow change trigger)
- **Notes**: Prevents runs on irrelevant changes. Benefit seen when frontend/docs change.

### 6. Cache dependencies
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #43
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 31s (511 seconds) - first run
- **Time Saved**: -1 second (cache build overhead)
- **Notes**: First run builds cache. Subsequent runs will show savings.

### 8. Optimize Dojo installation
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: #44
- **Total Workflow Time**: 8m 24s (504 seconds)
- **Time Saved**: 7 seconds (1.4% improvement)
- **Notes**: Streamlined installation, removed sudo requirement.

### 9. Parallel execution within job
- **Date**: 2025-07-16
- **PR**: Not implemented
- **Total Workflow Time**: N/A
- **Time Saved**: N/A
- **Notes**: Steps have sequential dependencies (format→build→test). No parallelization opportunity.

## Final Results Summary

### Overall Performance
- **Baseline**: 9m 8s (548 seconds)
- **After optimizations**: 8m 24s (504 seconds)
- **Total Time Saved**: 44 seconds
- **Percentage Improvement**: 8.0%

### Most Effective Changes
1. **Remove setup-environment job**: 45s saved (8.2%)
2. **Optimize Dojo installation**: 7s saved (1.4%)
3. **Combine jobs**: 5s saved (1.0%)
4. **Update actions**: 4s saved (0.8%)

### Changes with High Simplicity/Performance Ratio
1. Remove setup-environment job (trivial change, 45s saved)
2. Update to latest actions (version bump, 4s saved)
3. Add timeout-minutes (safety feature, no performance impact)
4. Optimize file path ignores (prevents unnecessary runs)

### Changes with Lower Impact
- Cache dependencies: First run overhead, benefits on subsequent runs
- Combine jobs: Small gain due to loss of parallelism

### Recommendations
The following changes provide the best simplicity-to-performance ratio:
1. Remove setup-environment job
2. Update to latest actions
3. Add timeout-minutes
4. Optimize file path ignores
5. Cache dependencies (for long-term benefits)
